## Description
This repository will serve as the home for my new **LightTrackerBackend**. It is an attempt to learn **MongoDB** and develop a robust backend for the application.

## Technologies
This backend will be built using the following technologies:
- **MongoDB**
- **Express.js**
- **Node.js**

## Front-End Concepts
You can find my ideas for the look and usage of the front end here: [View Figma Concepts](https://www.figma.com/board/oKUfEGiBStwHzBbx3sfdTl/lightTrakr?node-id=0-1&t=RfA21dsQ0pbPwEjy-1)
